      <h2 class="fs-3 text-secondary">Education:</h2>
      <p lead class="text-secondary lead mb-3">I started my programming studies in high school where I studied the technology program at Polhemskolan in Lund. There I took 2 HTML courses, as well as a C# course and a SQL database course. This led to a newfound appreciation for programming which eventually led me to apply to Malm√∂ University to study Computer Science with specialization in Game Development. This gave me skills mainly in C#, Unity, MonoGame, SQL, and C++. After those studies ended the job market was rough and I didn't feel fullfilled so I applied for a Frontend education at Grit Academy, which is where I am today.</p>
      <h2 class="fs-3 text-secondary">Work Experience:</h2>
      <p lead class="text-secondary lead mb-3">
        I have had the luxury of having som very rewarding jobs throughout the years, starting as a backoffice assistant at Guldcentrum Sverige AB, where I was tasked with creating and maintaining product articles for the website. After that I got to be a customer service rep at the same company, which involved answering e-mails, phone calls, and live chat. I have also had an internship at Commerz Consultants AB where I worked as assistant project lead, where I mainly partook in client meeetings and created JIRA tickets for the developers. I was also tasked with creating project specifications for certain projects which has helped me get a administrative view on web development.
